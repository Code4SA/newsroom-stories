  <p class="infoContext">The early 2000s were a terrible time in South Africa when a plague of biblical proportions swept through South Africa. Hardest hit by the HIV and Aids pandemic were the poor, mostly living in townships and rural areas. It took a heavy toll, claiming the lives of 330,000 people, between 2000 and 2005, indiscriminately killing old and young alike. The only way to fight the pandemic was with ARVs. But this life-saving medication was expensive and only available to private patients and through a handful of privately-funded pilot programmes. Yet even as the death toll mounted President Thabo Mbeki’s administration, which has come to be defined by its Aids denialism, dismissed ARVs as toxic. Instead they recommended a diet of beetroot, African potato, garlic and lemon, for those who were infected</p>

  <p>ENDLESS ‘scientific’ studies that tried to prove there was no link between HIV and AIDS, and claims that the virus could be held at bay with a diet of fruit, vegetables and vitamins, marked South Africa’s decade of denialism under President Thabo Mbeki.</p><p>As the President pontificated, the virus claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of lives as a plague of biblical proportions swept through South Africa’s townships and rural areas.</p><p>From 1999, when he was elected President, to 2008, when his second term came to an abrupt end, Thabo Mbeki steadfastly denied that HIV causes AIDS. He even went as far as to institute policies that denied access to antiretrovirals (ARVs) for seriously ill people infected with the virus.</p><p>At the height of the pandemic lifesaving ARVs were available, but only via very expensive, private treatment. Or for a lucky few, if they fell within the catchment areas of non-State, privately-funded pilot programmes.</p><p>In newsletters penned late at night, Mbeki argued his theory that the risks of ARVs outweighed the benefits and were “poisonous”. At the same time his Minister of Health, Dr Manto Tshabalala Msimimang, advocated vitamins, African potatoes, lemons, beetroot and garlic as a remedy.</p><p>"Shall I repeat garlic, shall I talk about beetroot, shall I talk about lemon... these delay the development of HIV to Aids-defining conditions, and that's the truth," the minister, nicknamed Dr Beetroot, said in a debate on her department's budget vote in 2006.</p><p>The government was ordered by the Constitutional Court to provide ARV-nevirapine (which stops HIV from multiplying) in 2002. But it only began a slow rollout two years later, in 2004. By then, the virus had emerged as one of the biggest threats to post-apartheid reconstruction and development.</p><p>During that time photographer Fanie Jason and I became obsessed with telling the story of the dead and the dying, and the stigma they faced, to give them them a voice.</p>

  <p>I’m still haunted by the image of one woman we spoke to. She was in her 30s but made prematurely old by the disease. Her body was wasted and covered in sores and her dignity gone as she struggled to control her bowels. But her neighbours refused to let her use the communal public toilets because they believed she would infect them.</p><p>This is what people in townships and rural areas around South Africa were seeing on a daily basis.</p><p>The virus, in the guise of opportunistic infections like TB and pneumonia that took advantage of victims’ suppressed immune systems, was killing the young in ever-growing numbers.</p><p>A priest once told me after the burial of a schoolgirl: “Before this thing young people buried the old … now it is the old burying the children.”</p><p>But many people survived after they were put on to ARVs and, Phoenix-like, they “came back from the dead”.</p><p>Today antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV infection from a progressive, typically fatal infection to a chronic disease that can persist for many decades. A typical young adult who acquires HIV is expected to be on therapy for up to 50 years, according to a recent article in the Lancet medical journal.</p><p>Yet despite irrefutable data that proves how ARVs helped arrest the spiraling deaths once the government rollout began, Mbeki is still sticking to his guns.</p><p>From the most powerful office in the land he preached denialism - and today, from a leafy Joburg suburb, he’s still doing the same thing.</p><p>In a newsletter in March this year he once again reiterated his controversial views. Back in 2006 he said that, according to Statistics South Africa, tuberculosis was the country’s leading cause of deaths, while HIV and Aids were “the ninth”. He also questioned why a spotlight was being shone on HIV/Aids while, he claimed, less was being said and done about TB.</p><p>In his March 2016 newsletter he wrote: “Did this have to do with the fact that South Africa could be a lucrative market for the sale of ARVs, as it now is?”</p>

    <p>Sonabile died a few months before Mbeki was about to start his second term as president of South Africa.</p><p>By a fluke of geography, Lewu and his girlfriend lived within the catchment area of a Gugulethu clinic where a limited, privately-funded ARV pilot programme had begun in 2001.</p><p>His girlfriend qualified for the pilot programme, a partnership between the provincial government and non-governmental organisation Médecins Sans Frontières. Lewu did not, as his illness had not progressed to the stage where he could be accepted in the trials.</p><p>“Pandova was put on ARVs, but by then it was too late for her. There was nothing for our baby and she died. Both my sisters died because they did not have access to ARVs. I survived because, when I got sicker, I received ARVS,” he says.</p><p>“We were all very ill and survived on Padova’s government disability grant. It was a very hard time for us. It was also a highly politicised issue … people were dying because of politics.”</p><p>Anthony, who takes a daily dose of ARVs and lives a normal life, says he found out that he had HIV when he was tested for TB.</p><p>“Other people were scared to be tested … they were living in denial. They were also afraid of the stigma and for others to find out they were infected. When it became known that someone had the virus, they were isolated by the community. It makes me angry. A lot of lives would have been saved if the government had not politicised the issue. People would have gone to clinics to be tested and would not have been afraid for people to know their status.”</p>

  <h2>Suffer the little children</h2>
  <p class="byline">by RAYMOND JOSEPH and ROXANNE JOSEPH</p>
  <p>A section of the Gugulethu cemetery in Cape Town bears mute testimony to the deadly toll the disease took on the very young, many of them infected when the virus was transmitted to them by their HIV positive mothers at birth. Spanning a narrow, few hundred metre-long section of ground are the graves of babies and the very young.</p><p>There are very few tombstones in this section: it consists largely of tiny grave with broken, weatherworn wooden crosses.</p><p>Where dates on the crosses are still legible, and on the few tombstones, it soon becomes clear that they date from the early 2000s to around 2007, when the virus was running rampant.</p>

  <h2>Ithumaleng Letsatsi - A story of survival</h2>

  <p>IN 2001, when he was just three years old, Ithumaleng Letsatsi awoke one morning to find his mother, Cheryl-Anne, dead in the bed next to him.</p><p>Now almost 19 and on a daily dose of ARVs, Ithumaleng, who lives in Khayelitsha, was infected with the virus at birth by his HIV positive mother.</p>

    <p>As a child he was ostracised by the neighbourhood children in Philippi, where he lived with his HIV positive father Goodrich, because their parents feared they would contract the virus from him. And the crèche he was attending told his father he was no longer welcome after some parents objected and removed their children.</p><p>A year after his mother’s death his father died from tuberculosis, one of the opportunistic diseases that often strike down Aids sufferers.</p><p>But his tragic story also revealed another, kinder face of the Aids pandemic: the angels who without pay or recognition helped care for sick people, washing their diseased bodies and ensuring they had food.</p><p>In this case it was an unemployed man, Patrick Titi, who took on the unpaid role as caregiver to young Ithumaleng and his father. Patrick was consumed by guilt because he had not been there for his own son, who was dying of Aids in Port Elizabeth. His son was cared for by a friend in his dying days.</p>

    <p>Speaking at the time, Patrick said: “These people with Aids are just like you and me…it is a terrible disease and anyone can get it. We must not turn our backs on these people who are suffering.”</p><p>Today Ithumaleng, who has a learning disability, lives with his father’s brother, Eric Letsatsi, and his wife Edith, in Khayelitsha.</p><p>“When Tumi came to us he was very sick. He was covered in blisters and the doctors said he wouldn’t live. He was put on ARVs when he was 11 and his face got full and he got his appetite back. Before ARVs he struggled and was sick a lot, but now it is different.”</p><p>Remembering the dark, desperate days of the pandemic, Edith says: “It was terrible at that time. Lots of people were dying, family, friends, their children ... and there was nothing you could do. And there was the stigma that was attached, so no-one admitted it was Aids when someone got ill or died. They always came up with something else to explain it.”</p>


  <h2>Annasuena Malebo - left behind</h2>
  
  <p>ANNASUENA Malebo was 10 years old when her mother died in August 2002. Anneline Malebo, a member of the all-woman group Joy, which had a hit with the iconic song Paradise Road, had refused to pay for ARVs because she wanted to leave some money to her daughter.</p><p>The singer was infected with HIV after she was raped at a party in 2000. Although there was a limited ARV pilot underway in Gugulethu where she lived, she fell out of the catchment area and was unable to access the lifesaving drugs.</p><p>Bravely, and unlike most who were infected, Malebo decided to go public about her status. She believed that her one-time fame would help raise the debate about the virus and the lack of access to ARVs for the poor.</p><p>All but forgotten by her friends and shunned by her community she slowly wasted away and died of an Aids-related illness.</p><p>Annasuena, who mostly only saw her mother on weekends, said: “I could see she was frail, but she always acted strong and positive when I was around. My older brother, Linden, cleaned and washed her. When I was around I helped, gave her meds; I saw how sick she was, but I had to be strong, I could not cry in front of her.</p>

  <p>“When I asked her what was wrong, she said it was high blood pressure. I grew up quicker than most kids of my age. That happens when you are a carer at the age of 10 to someone who is very sick.”</p><p>When it became clear that Malebo would not be able to access the free ARV programme a benefit concert was held to raise money to pay for the medication. Top musicians donated their performances for free and thousands of rands were raised.</p><p>But Malebo refused to use the money for ARVs and effectively signed her own death warrant by insisting it instead be used to support Annasuena and her younger sister Naledi, who was six. Shortly before she died Malebo, her health rapidly failing, was admitted to a private clinic.</p><p>“The last time I saw her she was joking and singing to me and I hoped that she was getting better. Until then I hated visiting her in hospital, I was scared of losing her; that she was going to die.”</p><p>Tears brimming in her eyes, Annasuena adds angrily: “If antiretrovirals were available for everyone then, it is possible she could still be alive. I have made peace with mom’s death. At least today, with ARVs available, people are living longer.”</p>

  <p>WHILE people continue to die in South Africa of Aids-related illnesses, an analysis of data from 1997 to 2014 reveals a drastic decline in deaths of children aged birth to 10 since President Jacob Zuma came to power.</p><p>There has been a 37% decrease in deaths in this age range, dropping from 898 in 2000 to 564 in 2014.</p><p>And the number of babies under one year old who died in 2000 compared to 2014 has dropped by 55%, from 503 to 277.</p><p>The difference between the Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma administrations’ approach to the HIV/Aids epidemic is starkly illustrated by in statistics.</p>

  <p>The highest number of deaths in children aged between one and 10 during the Mbeki administration occurred in 2006, when 1154, died. The highest number of children to die in this age range during the Zuma administration was when deaths spiked 2010, when 883 children died. During this time period, there was a 48% decrease in recorded deaths of children.</p><p>And between 2006 and 2014, the decrease in child deaths dropped by 51%, from 1154 to 564.</p><p>It is far more difficult to track the deaths of adults, because the year in which they were infected is impossible to gauge from Stats SA data. But with children there is more certainty as it is possible to know the maximum time period they could have been infected.</p>

  <p>‘Oxytherapy’ using ozone, hyperthermia via high temperature baths and Virodene, a drug composed of the toxic industrial solventdimethylformamide, were just a few of the “cures” on offer in South Africa. There were also numerous cases of fraudulent traditional healers, while fake ARVs, often composed of toxic substances, caused illness and death.</p>

  <h1 class="uppercase">The Church of hope</h1>
  <p>EACH day, scores of schoolchildren line up for their plate of food at the JL Zwane Memorial Church in Gugulethu.</p><p>The church is a beacon of hope for those struggling to survive, but a decade ago it was assisting a different kind of needy population - those afflicted with HIV and Aids.</p><p>At a time when treatment was available only to a fortunate few, the church offered support, love and comfort and regular meals to those infected by the virus, no matter their religious denomination.</p><p>“It was a terrible time, people were dying all the time,” says Reverend Siphiwo Xaphile. A lot of people in our community were at the point of dying; they’d given up hope. There was no support from government.”</p><p>The church made a decision to do something rather than just sit by watching, he says. “The gift we gave people was the gift of presence, being there when they needed it.</p><p>“Even the clinics, without access to ARVs, would refer people to our church. They knew that at least we would be able to give people food and support and a feeling of being loved and accepted.”</p><p>But there was also a feeling of helplessness among those helping the sick and dying.</p>

  <p>“It was the only time the church did not have what it claimed to have. We could not wait; people were dying so we got involved in education programmes that had to do with human sexuality. “But the church did not have a language to talk about that, so we had to take a risk,” he says.</p><p>It was a brave decision, but it put Xaphile into direct conflict with the Presbyterian Church, which ostracised him. While the church advocates abstinence outside of marriage, the JL Zwane leadership recognised that the sexually transmitted virus was killing people.</p><p>“Commitment leads you to spaces you thought you would never go to. We distributed condoms and some members of the congregation pretended they were seeing them for the first time.”</p><p>When the Presbyterian Church ostracised him, support came from the most unlikely of places. The Open Arms Church in Minnesota in the US, which was ministering to gay people living with HIV and Aids, offered financial help to JL Zwane for its work.</p><p>Ironically, as a result of this partnership, Presbyterian churches in the US reached out to Open Arms, even as the local church failed to support what was happening at the ZL Zwane in Gugulethu.</p><p>The JL Zwane Church did more than feed, educate and comfort people; it also embarked on a course of advocacy and joined the TAC (Treatment Action Campaign) on a march to Parliament “to bring pressure on the government to intervene and supply ARVs.</p><p>Today, with ARVs and a better understanding of HIV and Aids, the feeding programme has ended and the church instead now feeds scores of schoolchildren every day.</p><p>But the memories of those dark days linger on in the minds of those who fought the scourge and those who were helped and survived to tell their stories.</p>
