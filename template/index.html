	<p>On the eve of the International Aids conference in Durban and 12 years after the first private ARV pilot programme was launched in 2001, <strong>Raymond Joseph</strong> looks back at South Africa's rocky road to HIV-freedom, and revisits some of the families destroyed by Mbeki's Aids denialism</p>

	<h2>Suffer the little children</h2>

	<p>“When I asked her what was wrong, she said it was high blood pressure. I grew up quicker than most kids of my age. That happens when you are a carer at the age of 10 to someone who is very sick.” When it became clear that Malebo would not be able to access the free <a href="#" target="_blank">ARV programme</a> a benefit concert was held to raise money to pay for the medication. Top musicians donated their performances for free and thousands of rands were raised. But Malebo refused to use the money for ARVs and effectively signed her own death warrant by insisting it instead be used to support Annasuena and her younger sister Naledi, who was six. Shortly before she died Malebo, her health rapidly failing, was admitted to a private clinic.</p>

	<p>“The last time I saw her she was joking and singing to me and I hoped that she was getting better. Until then I hated visiting her in hospital, I was scared of losing her; that she was going to die. ”Tears brimming in her eyes, Annasuena adds angrily: “If antiretrovirals were available for everyone then, it is possible she could still be alive. I have made peace with mom’s death. At least today, with ARVs available, people are living longer.” That happens when you are a carer at the age of 10 to someone who is very sick.” When it became clear that Malebo would not be able to access the free ARV programme a benefit concert was held to raise money to pay for the medication.
