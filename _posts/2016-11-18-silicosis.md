From the air there is a certain beauty and symmetry in the juxtaposition of Tierboskloof, a luxury gated estate and Imizamo Yethu Bay, the township on the side of a mountain. Both areas are situated right beside one another in the small fishing town of Hout Bay, about 20 minutes outside Cape Town.

But while the physical distance between these homes is only a few hundred metres, residentsâ€™ lives and living conditions are worlds apart.
