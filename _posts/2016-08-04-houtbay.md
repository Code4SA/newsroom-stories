From the air there is a certain beauty and symmetry in the juxtaposition of Tierboskloof, a luxury gated estate and Imizamo Yethu Bay, the township on the side of a mountain. Both areas are situated right beside one another in the small fishing town of Hout Bay, about 20 minutes outside Cape Town.

But while the physical distance between these homes is only a few hundred metres, residents’ lives and living conditions are worlds apart.

WHEN Brian Rolfe looks out of a top floor window of his two storey luxury home in the Valley, his view is the sea of formal and informal homes that make up Imizamo Yethu. Literally a stone’s throw away from homes like his are the shacks of the township, built with little more than an outstretched arm apart. Boyce Elcot Dyantyi, who has built his own basic, brick house within that sea of shacks, is a long-time resident of Imizamo Yethu.

“Sitting up here, it does make me feel very guilty,” admits Rolfe. “How do you deserve to be here and not on that side? It’s just crazy.” 

“It’s a shack with a view,” declares Dyantyi, gesturing to mountains, forests and sea that surround his home. “And one day, we’ll be just like them, beautiful houses and all.”

“When I asked her what was wrong, she said it was high blood pressure. I grew up quicker than most kids of my age. That happens when you are a carer at the age of 10 to someone who is very sick.” When it became clear that Malebo would not be able to access the free ARV programme a benefit concert was held to raise money to pay for the medication. Top musicians donated their performances for free and thousands of rands were raised. But Malebo refused to use the money for ARVs and effectively signed her own death warrant by insisting it instead be used to support Annasuena and her younger sister Naledi, who was six. Shortly before she died Malebo, her health rapidly failing, was admitted to a private clinic. “The last time I saw her she was joking and singing to me and I hoped that she was getting better. Until then I hated visiting her in hospital, I was scared of losing her; that she was going to die.
